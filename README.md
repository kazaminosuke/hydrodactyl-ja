Hydrodactyl is the Pterodactyl-based game server management panel that focuses on performance enhancements, a reimagined, accessible interface, and top-tier developer experience. Builds faster, compiles smaller: Hydrodactyl is the world's best Pterodactyl.

## Changes from vanilla Pterodactyl

- **Smaller bundle sizes:** Hydrodactyl is built using Vite, and significant design changes mean Hydrodactyl's initial download size is over **[170 times smaller than leading Pterodactyl forks, including Pelican](https://i.imgur.com/tKWLHhR.png)**.
- **Faster build times:** Hydrodactyl completes builds in milliseconds with the power of Turbo. Cold builds with zero cache finish in **under 7 seconds**.
- **Faster loading times:** Hydrodactyl's load times are, on average, **[over 16 times faster](https://i.imgur.com/28XxmMi.png)** than other closed-source Pterodactyl forks and Pelican. Smarter code splitting and chunking means that pages you visit in the panel only load necessary resources on demand. Better caching means that everything is simply _snappy_.
- **More secure:** Hydrodactyl's modern architecture means **most severe and easily exploitable CVEs simply do not exist**. We have also implemented SRI and integrity checks for production builds.
- **More accessible:** Hydrodactyl builds with the latest Web accessibility guidelines in mind. Hydrodactyl is **entirely keyboard-navigable, even context menus**, and screen-readers are easily compatible.
- **More approachable:** Hydrodactyl's friendly, approachable interface means that anyone can confidently run a game server.
